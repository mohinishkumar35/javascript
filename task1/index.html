        The Nile is a major north-flowing river in northeastern Africa. It flows into the Mediterranean Sea. 
        The Nile is the longest river in Africa and has historically been considered the longest river in the world. 
        Though this has been contested by research suggesting that the Amazon River is slightly longer of the world's major rivers.
        The Nile is one of the smallest, as measured by annual flow in cubic metres of water.
